# Infinite

**Infinite** is a sample project showcasing the full capabilities of [Solara](https://github.com/Solara-Kit/Solara) for managing white label apps. This comprehensive demonstration highlights the key features and functionalities of Solara, offering developers and app owners a hands-on experience with the library's power and flexibility.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains three separate projects: **Flutter**, **Native iOS**, and **Native Android**. Each project is designed to be run independently.

## Solara Integration

This repository is intended for developing Solara. As such, Solara is integrated as a local gem in the `Gemfile` as follows:

```ruby
gem 'solara', path: '../solara'
```

The path points to the parent folder of Infinite, so you should clone [Solara](https://github.com/Solara-Kit/Solara) at that location:

```
parent-folder/
    ├── solara/
    └── infinite/
```
